Project Description: 
Implemented Travelling Salesman Problem using different algorithm design techniques. Typically, the problem has been analyzed based on the complexity of 4 different algorithms based on a small number of inputs(i.e 4 cities) which admittedly led to a conclusion by finding the best of all determined by their time complexity.
The programming language used: Java
